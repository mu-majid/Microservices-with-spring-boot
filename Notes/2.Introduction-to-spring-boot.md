### Spring platform:

- This platform was introduced to solve the infamous heavyweight deployment descriptors of J2EE.
- Spring Boot is part of the Spring Framework.
- Spring I=introduced the idea of Dependency Injection, which made development much omre light weight.
- Spring boot uses *convention over configuration* design pattern, that is, the framework setup all core modules and 3rd libraries without the need of any configuration files.
- Any convention could be overriden by a small config file.
- Spring supports fat JAR files(files that include the application and al its dependencies in one file) and also WAR files (files that need some J2EE server to host it, like Apache Tomcat)

#### Examples of convention-based autoconfig:

- This pattern of convention is intiated by annotating the application class with `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.

```java

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(string[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args)
    }
}

```

- This annotation enables the following: 
1. component scanning, meaning, looking for Spring components and configuration in the app class package and in the sub packages (folders).
2. Application class itself becomes a config class.
3. Enable spring boot to look in the classpath for JAR files that it can enable automatically. For example if timcat was in the classpath, Spring will autoconfigure it as an embedded web server.

- Component Scanning by Spring enables dependency injection.
- DI could be achieved in three main ways, Field, Setter, and Constructor Injection.
- Field and setter DI uses the `@AutoWired`annotation coming from Spring.
- Always prefer to use constructor DI, as it makes the state of the components immutable and thread safe.
- `@ComponentScan`annotation tells spring to include components from a package outside the application package

```java

@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan({"com.majid.otherpackage"})
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(string[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args)
    }
}

```

- Annotating a class with `@Configuration` makes it available to all other components by the component scanning mechanism, and this decorator is useful when we want to override some default Spring config. [Note: Application class also become config class by SpringBootApplication annot.]
